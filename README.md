# Integrated Risk App (Python)

**Model Risk Validation Sandbox for Market & Credit Risk (Python)**

This project is a **model-risk–oriented risk analytics engine** designed to measure, validate, and document market and credit risk models in a manner consistent with institutional risk management and model validation practices.

The focus is not on building a dashboard, but on demonstrating rigorous risk modeling, backtesting, and governance-aware design, with clear assumptions, diagnostics, and limitations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective (North Star)

Build a **validation-ready risk engine** that computes core risk measures (VaR, ES, Expected Loss) and evaluates their reliability using standard model risk diagnostics.

This repository is structured to resemble how **pensions, model risk teams, and risk consultancies** organize and review quantitative risk models.

---

## 📌 Scope (What This Project Intentionally Covers)

### Market Risk

- Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
- Methods:
  - Historical Simulation
  - Parametric (Normal)
  - Monte Carlo
  - Filtered Historical (GARCH-lite)
- Rolling window estimation
- Backtesting using **Kupiec Proportion-of-Failures (POF) test**
- Multi-confidence-level calibration (e.g. 95%, 99%)

### Credit Risk

- Expected Loss (EL) framework:
  - Probability of Default (PD)
  - Loss Given Default (LGD)
  - Exposure at Default (EAD)
- Batch portfolio-level aggregation
- Segment-level loss breakdown for monitoring

### Stress & Scenario Analysis

- Deterministic equity shocks
- Interest-rate shocks using duration approximations
- Correlation stress
- Historical window replay

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope (By Design)

To preserve clarity and rigor, this project does **not** attempt to be:

- A trading or portfolio optimization system
- A real-time production risk engine
- A regulatory-approved model

Advanced extensions (e.g. factor models, ALM, optimization) are intentionally deferred.

---

## 🖥 Application Interface

A lightweight **Streamlit interface** is provided only as a viewer to:

- Run models with selected parameters
- Visualize backtests and stress results
- Inspect outputs interactively

All core modeling logic resides outside the UI to ensure separation between **model logic** and **presentation**.

**Live Demo:** https://integrated-risk-app.onrender.com/

## 📸 Example Outputs

### Market Risk Backtesting (VaR & Exceptions)

Daily portfolio returns plotted against the VaR threshold.  
Red points represent exceedances used in Kupiec backtesting.

### Credit Risk – Expected Loss (Batch)

Aggregated EL with breakdown by segment, illustrating portfolio-level credit exposure.

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

- **VaR**: loss threshold exceeded with probability \(1 - \alpha\)
- **Expected Shortfall**: average loss conditional on VaR exceedance
- **Kupiec POF Test**: statistical test for unconditional coverage
- **Filtered Historical Simulation**: volatility-adjusted return filtering
- **Expected Loss**:  
  \[
  \text{EL} = \text{PD} \times \text{LGD} \times \text{EAD}
  \]

All models follow a **loss-based convention** (risk measures reported as positive loss values).

---

## 🧪 Validation & Testing Philosophy

This project emphasizes **model validation**, not just model output.

- Unit tests verify:
  - Monotonicity of VaR across confidence levels
  - ES ≥ VaR under consistent loss conventions
  - Correct behavior of backtesting logic
  - Credit EL aggregation consistency
- Backtesting results are interpretable and reproducible
- Assumptions and limitations are explicitly acknowledged

📄 Documentation

A Model Risk Report (methodology, assumptions, validation results, and limitations) is maintained in the /docs directory and is intended to mirror institutional model documentation standards.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for educational and demonstrative purposes only.
It is not intended for production use or investment decision-making.

⭐ Why This Project Exists

This repository is designed as a work sample for roles in:

Risk Analytics

Model Risk / Model Validation

Credit Risk

Pension & Institutional Investment Risk

Risk Consulting

It reflects how quantitative risk models are built, tested, challenged, and documented — not just how they are computed.
